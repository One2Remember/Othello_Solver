# Othello_Solver
Python and LISP solutions to the Othello boardgame for Artificial Intelligence, CSU East Bay, Spring 2020

These console applications aim to solve the traditional Othello boardgame using an adapted version of the Minimax Decision Algorithm as given in "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd ed" by Russel and Norvig.

**main.py** contains the python program capable of beating any human

**reversi.lisp** contains the LISP program capable of beating any human

They are essentially the same program, simply offered in two languages. I originally wrote the program in python, as I was more familiar with its syntax, and then adapted the program to work with the LISP interpreter per my professor's specifications.
